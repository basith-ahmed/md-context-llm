 Basith's Portfolio

Hey, welcome to my portfolio!

  

I'm a Web Developer and ML enthusiast from Kerala, India, I dwell in the art of
coding and the science of creation. Forever drawn to the confluence of
imagination and technology, I craft to inspire and innovate.

Beyond code, I find solace in the whispers of books, the strokes of a sketch,
and the melodies of music. Enchanted by the mysteries of theoretical physics,
the cadence of poetry, and the depth of philosophy, I wander ceaselessly through
the labyrinth of ideas and the boundless realms of thought.

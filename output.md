Title: Basith's Portfolio

Page Contents:

Hey, welcome to my portfolio\!

  

I'm a Web Developer and ML enthusiast from Kerala, India, I dwell in the art of coding and the science of creation. Forever drawn to the confluence of imagination and technology, I craft to inspire and innovate.

Beyond code, I find solace in the whispers of books, the strokes of a sketch, and the melodies of music. Enchanted by the mysteries of theoretical physics, the cadence of poetry, and the depth of philosophy, I wander ceaselessly through the labyrinth of ideas and the boundless realms of thought.
